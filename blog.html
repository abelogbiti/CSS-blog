   <h2>This Is My Article</h2>

   <p class="quote">Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
   Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
   Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
   You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher
   So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
   Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers   
   Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
   Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
   Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
   Sleep is the cousin, we're a fuckin' family picture
   You know father time, we all know mother nature
   It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
   No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration
   Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation</p>

   <p>Paper chasing, tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
   Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
   People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
   Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
   You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
   I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
   Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
   Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
   Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
   Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell</p>

   <p>Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
   Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
   Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
   And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
   I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
   Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
   Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
   Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler</p>

	My granny called, she said, "Travvy, you work too hard
    I'm worried you forget about me"
    I'm falling in and out of clouds, don't worry, I'ma get it, Granny, uh
    What happened? Now my daddy happy
    Mama called me up, that money coming and she love me
    I done made it now, I done found life's meaning now
    All them days her heart'd break, her heart not in pieces now
	</p>

	<p>Friends turning into fraud niggas
    Practicing half the passion, you niggas packaged different
    All you niggas, you niggas want the swag, you can't have it
    I'ma sell it, your niggas salary 'bout to cap bitch
    Youngest nigga out of Houston at the Grammys
    Smiling at 'em laughing at me
    I passed the rock to Ye, he pump faked then passed it back, bitch
    All of this off of rapping, should've wrote this in Latin, yeah, yeah</p>

    <p>Mmm, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
    I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
    Cuzzo said we in the store', yeah, we 'bout to drop a four
    He passed the cigarette, I choke, woo
    Told my auntie put them 'Ports down, them 'Ports down
    Now you know you love your own now
    Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
    I ain't knockin', nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now
    Whole crew, I swear they counting on me
    Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
    Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
    Holy Father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em</p>
